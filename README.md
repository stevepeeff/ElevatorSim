# ElevatorSim
Async Example of A Elevator and Hal and a Non State Pattern

I've created this application to investigate the difficulty of 'asynchronization' (The elevator hal acts as a 'real-time' system).

The state pattern is not correctly implemented. I did not want to use a if/else or switch case construction. I find this solution more readable.

The implementation uses 3 floors, the design can handle an infinite number of floors.
