The engine implements the logic of the system (provided by the Interface)

It creates and maintains the domain entities
The 'Engine' uses the models to update the state of the system
The logic does NOT have any knowledge of the UI (so View and ViewModel), nor does it depends on it.
It calls (uses) functions for persistence (via the DAL), but it does NOT have any knowledge of persistence technique/implementation
