This folder holds the (domain) models (It should be in the project where the Interface of the engine is defined)

The models do NOT have any knowledge of the UI (so View and ViewModel). 
Nor do the have any knowledge of persistence (DAL)
The 'Engine' uses the models to update the state of the system
